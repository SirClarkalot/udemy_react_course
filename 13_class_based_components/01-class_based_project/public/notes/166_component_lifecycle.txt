Can't use hooks with class components

Life cycle methods:

  componentDidMount()
    same as useEffect(..., []) with an empty array

  componentDidUpdate()
    called when component is updated
    same as useEffect with dependencies

  componentWillUnmount()
    called before component is removed from the DOM
    same as a timeout function in useEffect
