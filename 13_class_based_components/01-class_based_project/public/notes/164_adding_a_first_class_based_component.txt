  render () {} in a class based component is sumilar to
  return () in a function based component

  Need to use Component to make props work...for example:
  import { Component } from 'react';
  Class User extends Component
  ...Works similar to class inheritance
  Need to add 'this' keyword to make props work. For example...
  {props.name} === {this.props.name}

  Class based components can work with functional based components
