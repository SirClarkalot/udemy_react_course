In this app the forward and backward code basically do the same thing
Whenever there's duplicate code, we should refactor

You can only call react hooks in react component functions...
or custom hooks

Therefore need to build a custom hook

Create a hooks folder next to the components folder
  function you create MUST start with 'use'
  'use' signals that it will be a custom hook
